# Some history

-   I grew up in a black biker gang in Colorado. Sleeping under pool tables and behind bars was a norm I thought every kid endured. It was my younger sister and I against the world. While my mother played cards, flirted and drank.
-   Don't get me wrong, My mother was nurturing and protective. A great single mother who did the very best she could with 2 young kids. She taught us to be street smart, question authority and to always think critically.
-   After survivng a near death motor cycle accident that left the driver roadkill we left the biker gang and moved into a quiet suburb with my uncles family. There I spent time with my cousins who were into technology and counter culture.
-   Under their influence I cultivated an appetite for truth and possibilities. Which eventually lead me to study art and theology at the university level. I then went on to become a writer in hollywood. Working in the production world in art and camera departments for 15years. As a serial entreprenuer I always had a side business which kept me from commiting to any union. But the tenacity and life of taking risks taught me more about myself and what life can be than any union or university.
-   Despite my more than typical difficult childhood I was able to tune into my gift of seeing the future through the lens of technology and culture. This lead me to writing and building business' that explore the sublime spiritual influence of hiphop culture. I truth I explore in my work to this day.
-   In 2016 I began being paid to make websites in Bitcoin. This started a love affair with blockchain that has lead me to starting my own blockchain startup in 2021. I am also studying in the Emurgo acamdemy to become a certified Cardano blockchain developer.
-   Im very excited to continue to build my knowledge and solutions to many of the worlds problems with this technology.

Ive also exhibited my hiphop chocolate companys wears at a chocolate convention in Belgium. Travel opens the heart to humility and the mind to possibility.
